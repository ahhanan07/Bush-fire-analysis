# Advanced Regression Techniques to Forecast Bushfires

In this project we aim to create models that can predict the area burned in fires. We will be working with data from the UCI machine learning repository and is a collection curated by scientists Paulo Cortez and Anibal Morais from the Unviersity of Minho, Portugal.

The data includes meteorological measurements taken at the time the fire was reported, spatial/temporal measurements, and index metrics that take into a account weather data in the recent past. The index metrics are a part of the Canadian Fire Weather Index System (FWI). The data was collected from January 2000 to December 2003 from the northeast region of Portugal. Data was collected from a total of 517 fires.

Many different ML models can be applied - in the basis paper the one who achieved the best performance was Support Vector Machines (SVM). However, in this project we will be testing advanced regression techniques only.

## Project Development

- Data exploration and manipulation. Data reshaping and outlier removal to enhance the dataset.
- Create models to predict the burned area according to different regression techniques.
- Compare the models performance and choose a winner.

## Advanced Regression

We make use of advanced techniques such as subset selection, removal of influential points and so on.
